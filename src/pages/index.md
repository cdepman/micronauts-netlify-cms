        Everything around you is waiting to be explored. Your hair, your
        dog/cat's hair, your tap water, a drop of milk, a grain of sand, a
        crystal of salt, a thread from your t-shirt, the wing of a house fly.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
