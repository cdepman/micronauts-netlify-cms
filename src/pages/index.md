  title: Why Explore Microscopic Worlds?
  description: Micronauts are like astronauts - but exploring the world at a scale
    where amoebas are fearsome predators; computer circuits are like city
    streets viewed from space; and chemical or geological crystals become
    jaw-dropping art.
description: The answers to so many questions sit right in front of us, around
  us, inside us - we've only begun to understand how our world works. Major
  advances in our understanding of and approach to health, disease, agriculture,
  climate, energy have been unlocked at the microscopic level.

        Everything around you is waiting to be explored. Your hair, your
        dog/cat's hair, your tap water, a drop of milk, a grain of sand, a
        crystal of salt, a thread from your t-shirt, the wing of a house fly.

  heading: Who we are
  description: We want to empower more people to explore the worlds that exist
    within us, within the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the materials
    we touch every day.
